## Docker Images for Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains the Dockerfiles for building a lightweight Docker image for Octave, R, SciPy, and Pandas  with Jupyter Notebook. It also includes some useful Jupyter Notebook extensions, including LaTeX environment and spell checker.

These images are particularly useful for teaching, learning, and quick prototyping. The prebuilt images are available at <https://hub.docker.com/u/compdatasci>.
